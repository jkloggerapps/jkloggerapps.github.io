    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>PersonalLinkManager</strong> (the "App") is provided as an Ad-Supported app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to manage web links. Most data, including your saved links, is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device using a local database (RoomDB). We do not collect or upload your personal links to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Specifically, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob may collect data such as your device's advertising ID to provide personalized ads.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage (RoomDB)</h2>
    <p>All links and categories you create are stored on your device's internal storage. While we provide <strong>Import/Export</strong> features (JSON/HTML), you are responsible for the security of these files once they are exported from the App.</p>

    <h2>4. Log Data</h2>
    <p>In case of an error in the App, we may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, and the time and date of your use of the Service.</p>
